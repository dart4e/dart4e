## <a name="about"></a>About

Dart4E is an extension for the [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org) to support development using the [Dart](https://dart.dev) general purpose
programming language and the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application framework.

### Features
- Syntax Highlighting
- Source Code Formatting
- Auto Completion
- Code Refactoring
- [Interactive Dart Shell](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/dart_interactive) (REPL)
- Running and debugging of Dart programs/tests and Flutter applications
- Display direct and transitive dependencies in project outline

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation

If you don't have Eclipse installed you can install [Dart4E Studio](https://github.com/dart4e/dart-studio) - a custom Eclipse distribution - which has this plugin preinstalled.

To install Dart4E into an existing Eclipse installation do:
1. Within Eclipse go to: Help -> Install New Software...
1. Enter the following update site URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dart4e/dart4e/updatesite
1. Select the `Dart4E` feature to install.
1. Ensure that the option `Contact all update sites during install to find required software` is enabled.
1. Click `Next` twice.
1. Read/accept the license terms and click `Finish`.
1. Eclipse will now download the necessary files in the background.
1. When the download has finished, Eclipse will ask about installing unsigned content. You need to accept if you want to
1. After installation you will be prompted for a restart of Eclipse, which is recommended.


## <a id="building"></a>Building from Sources

To ensure reproducible builds this Maven project inherits from the [vegardit-maven-parent](https://github.com/vegardit/vegardit-maven-parent)
project which declares fixed versions and sensible default settings for all official Maven plug-ins.

The project also uses the [maven-toolchains-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/) which decouples the JDK that is
used to execute Maven and it's plug-ins from the target JDK that is used for compilation and/or unit testing. This ensures full binary
compatibility of the compiled artifacts with the runtime library of the required target JDK.

To build the project follow these steps:

1. Download and install a Java 17 SDK, e.g. from:
   - https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild
   - https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk17
   - https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk#download-openjdk

1. Download and install the latest [Maven distribution](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

1. In your user home directory create the file `.m2/toolchains.xml` with the following content:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8"?>
   <toolchains>
      <toolchain>
         <type>jdk</type>
         <provides>
            <version>17</version>
            <vendor>default</vendor>
         </provides>
         <configuration>
            <jdkHome>[PATH_TO_YOUR_JDK_17]</jdkHome>
         </configuration>
      </toolchain>
   </toolchains>
   ```

   Set the `[PATH_TO_YOUR_JDK_17]` parameter accordingly.

1. Checkout the code using one of the following methods:

    - `git clone https://github.com/dart4e/dart4e`
    - `svn co https://github.com/dart4e/dart4e dart4e`

1. Run `mvn clean verify` in the project root directory. This will execute compilation, unit-testing, integration-testing and
   packaging of all artifacts.
